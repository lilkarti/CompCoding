        Div elements divide your page by enclosing other elements. 
        These enclosed groups of elements can then be organized, moved and styled independently from one another.
        Basically rows for your website... so whatever is in this "class" will be on row
    
    <div class="container">

    
        Headings are a frequently used HTML element. You can think of them like headlines in a newspaper. 
        Your eyes may notice headings first because the words are large and bold compared to other text on the webpage.
        There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. h1 is the largest heading and h6 is the smallest.
        For best practice, you should avoid skipping heading levels. There should also be only one <h1> per HTML page. 
        Although skipping heading levels or using multiple <h1> elements will not cause errors in your code, it is important to keep a logical hierarchy of your HTML content. 
        If you are unhappy with the styling of the heading elements, its appearance should be modified using CSS.
    
	<h1>Welcome</h1>
    <h2>To my website</h2>
    
        Another essential HTML element is the unordered list. Items in an unordered list are referred to as list items. Each item is bulleted, not numbered. For example:

        A list item
        A second list item
        A third list item
        The HTML code for the list above:

        <ul> -> parent element
        <li>A list item</li> -> second item
        <li>A second list item</li>
        <li>A third list item</li>
        </ul> 
        About unordered lists:

        ul tags create the unordered list.


        li tags contain each list item.

        Unordered list elements can be used to organize content on a webpage in a number of ways. Below we will use one to organize our website’s navigation menu, sometimes called a navbar.
    
    <ul>
        <li>sign up</li>
        <li>search bikes</li>
        <li>reserve a bike</li>
        <li>about us</li>
     </ul>
    
        The HTML paragraph element, p, is used to hold one or more sentences, just like paragraphs in an essay or a book.
    
    <p>Paragraph text here</p>
    
         to link users to a different webpage? The HTML anchor element makes it possible to do this with a single click.
    
    <p>>Here is a <a href="cities.html">list</a> of cities where you can find us. </p>
    
        To add images to a webpage, use the HTML image element:
    
    <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/bikes1.jpg"/>
   
        The HTML video element can add video to a webpage.
        The video element uses a number of attributes. Let’s take a look at them:

        width and height: Set the size of the screen that displays the video.


        controls: Adds play, pause and volume control.


        source src: Sets the URL of the video to play.


        type: Specifies different video formats.
    
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
        <source src="https://content.codecademy.com/projects/make-a-website/lesson-1/ollie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    </div>
</body>
</html>



    HTML Review
Congratulations! You’ve learned enough HTML to create a great website!

Before we move on to styling with CSS, let’s review what we learned in this lesson.

Languages
html: stands for hypertext markup language, and is used to give a webpage structure.

css: stands for cascading style sheets, and is used to style HTML elements.
HTML Elements
h1 - h6: indicate text headings on a webpage. h1 is the largest heading; h6 is the smallest.

<h1>Heading</h1>
p: used for non-heading text, such as the bodies of articles or company descriptions.

<p>Description of company here.</p>
a: short for anchor and used to add links to other webpages. Anchor elements typically have an href attribute:

<a href="http://codecademy.com">Click here</a> to learn how to make a website!
img: used to add an image to a webpage. Image elements are self-closing and do not require a closing tag:

<img src="https://images.com/favorite.png">
video: used to add videos to a webpage, and uses multiple attributes and a nested source element:

<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://movies.io/great-clip.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
unordered list: used to create lists on a webpage and requires li elements inside a ul:

<ul>
  <li>list item</li>
  <li>another item</li>
  <li>yet another</li>
</ul>
div: used to organize HTML elements into different groups, which can be given a class attribute:

<div class="main">
  <h2>Subheading!</h2>
</div>
metadata tags: provide metadata about a webpage.

Web Concepts
parent/child elements: used to describe HTML elements that enclose or are enclosed by other elements. For example, below the ul is the parent and the li items are children:

<ul>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
